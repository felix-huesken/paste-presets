# paste-presets
A GNOME Extension to quickly copy and paste frequently used text, like your e-mail address or phone number.

This extension lets you specify text presets, which you can then call up and insert anywhere with the mouse or keyboard shortcuts. This requires write-access to the clipboard of course.
